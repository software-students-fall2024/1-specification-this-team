## Stakeholders
We identified 4 types of stakeholder for this software: pet stores, pet owners, pet lovers, and potential pet owners.<br><br>
- Pet Stores(We couldn't find a associated interviewee, so we generalized what we thought pet stores would desire in our app)<br>
    For pet stores, we define them as providers who supply products related to pets. Examples of such are:
    - Pet Shelters: Organizations that provide a temporary home for pets and offers adoptation services. 
    - Pet Supply Stores: Stores that sell pet food, pet leash, and all kinds of pet supplies. 
    - Veterinary Hospitals(Animal Clinics): Hospitals that care for pet's health. 

    Our app will implement an online shopping platform, similar to that of Amazon's, that is dedicated to pet products. Pet Supply stores can utilize this platform to post their products on our software. We will also implement a online reservation functionality where Pet Shelters and Vets can upload their avaliability for the consumers to choose. 
    For the pet stores, our app will help them spread their influences and potentially draw more customers to their product and services.<br>
- Pet Owners<br>
    Some of our group members are pet owners, and interviews with them suggest a great need for reliable, safe, yet affordable pet products. Pet owners, especially those who do not live in urban environments, often have trouble finding a local pet store, and some are too busy to pick up supplies from the stores themselves. Also, pet owners generally express concern about the quality of the pet products that they can find at local stores. Some pet owners with unusual pets find it difficult to buy special pet products locally. With our app, pet owners can choose from a variety of pet stores approved and endorsed by trusted pet organizations and experts, and then simply buy products online. If their pets get sick, they can also find and contact local, reliable animal hospitals through our app.<br>
    Pet owners also express the desire to share stories and videos of their pets and potentially connect with other pet owners. Our app provides such a platform for pet owners to socialize online. 
    <br>
- Pet Lovers<br>
    For pet lovers, we define pet lovers as those who are neither pet owners nor able to have a pet for various reasons, yet are very interested in pets. We believe this group represents the largest segment, as there are not many actual pet owners, but many who love pets. For these individuals, our app provides a great information and social platform where they can find share moments from others that interest them, allowing them to experience joy. This step significantly enhances user engagement, as both publishers and pet lovers receive positive feedback from it, supporting the app's data.<br>
    More importantly, as these pet lovers gradually learn more about our app, they may transition into potential pet owners and eventually become pet owners themselves, sharing their own moments. This undoubtedly brings sufficient vitality and a positive cycle to our app.<br>
- Potential Pet Owners<br>
    For potential pet owners, the main uses of this app revolve around understanding different pet species, viewing pet-related content, and connecting with breeders. Their primary goal is to educate themselves about the needs and characteristics of each species to avoid misinformation. This includes having access to a reliable wiki or animal associations that provide detailed information on pet care, health, and behavior. <br>
    Additionally, potential pet owners enjoy watching others share moments with their pets. Therefore, the app’s social feature should allow users to browse photos and stories of others' pets, fostering a sense of community and connection. Another key feature desired by potential pet owners is the ability to find trustworthy breeders or pet stores. This would help them avoid fraud and ensure a smoother, more reliable communication process with breeders or vendors, making it easier to find the right pet.<br><br>


## Product Vision Statement

Our app provides a comprehensive platform that affords pet lovers and owners access to reliable information and services while helping pet stores and animal institutions gain exposure, thus fostering a supportive pet-loving community.
