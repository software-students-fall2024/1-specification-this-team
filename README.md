## Stakeholders

We identified 4 types of stakeholder for this software: pet stores, pet owners, pet lovers, and potential pet owners.<br>
For potential pet owners, the main uses of this app revolve around understanding different pet species, viewing pet-related content, and connecting with breeders. Their primary goal is to educate themselves about the needs and characteristics of each species to avoid misinformation. This includes having access to a reliable wiki or animal associations that provides detailed information on pet care, health, and behavior. <br>
Additionally, potential pet owners enjoy watching others share moments with their pets. Therefore, the appâ€™s social feature should allow users to browse photos and stories of others' pets, fostering a sense of community and connection. Another key feature desired by potential pet owners is the ability to find trustworthy breeders or pet stores. This would help them avoid fraud and ensure a smoother, more reliable communication process with breeders or vendors, making it easier to find the right pet.
